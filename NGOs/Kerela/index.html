			<h3>Thanal Grama Sevavedi</h3>
			<h4>ABOUT</h4>
			<p>We started in 1986 as a small group of nature enthusiasts to bring environmental awareness to the people.  Our aim was to raise an environmentally conscious generation by conducting studies on natural history and bringing environmental education to schools and colleges.
			Our transformation from nature enthusiasts to serious environmental activists was triggered by the rise in pesticide use and pesticide related illness, increasing deforestation, improper handling of urban waste and other alarming issues.
			From the 1970s to the 2000s over 50000 villagers in the district of Kasargod were plagued by convulsions, physical deformities, congenital anomalies and cancer.  These maladies were traced to the pesticide Endosulfan sprayed over the cashew plantations.
			In 1998, along with the local community, e launched a highly vocal and public campaign, which resulted in the State Government putting a ban on Endosulfan use.  Later following up with studies, national debates, petitions and advocacy, India banned Endosulfan in 2011.

			<h3>Mano Vikas</h3>
			<h4>ABOUT</h4>
			<p>The founder of Manovikas was Mr.D.Jacob, whose younger brother and another brother's only daughter are intelectually disabled. In 1993, Mr.Jacob and his family members conducted a survey in Sasthamcotta village and found out 13 more such other children, below the age of 15. After a detailed study and guidence from National Institute for Mentally Handicapped (NIMH), Secundarabad, they started a small centre for the training and rehabilitation of these children in 1994. But within a month the number of children raised to 35. More and more parents came with their children and in 1996, Manovikas was registered as a charity of the parents and sibblings of the intellectually disabled. Duing 1998-1999, they started Community Based Rehabilitation(CBR) programmes for these children. CBR seems to be the only option available to meet the needs of the disabled especially in rural India. The CBR strategy is not a charity centered approach but one of meeting the special needs with in the community using community resources. This approach strengthens the community, supports the family to meet the needs of disabled and empowers the disabled to live as a contributive, participative member of the family.</p>

			<p>Sports & Education Promotion Trust (SEPT) was established to promote sports development in India with focus on football. Started in 2004 and based in Calicut, the trust has set up football training centres called “football nurseries” spread across 13 districts and Mahe. Majority of these centres are located in rural areas, one is in a tribal region. Given the huge potential in the tribal areas of Kerela which largely goes untapped due to financial constraints and lack of adequate sports infrastructure for the people of such area to pursue the game, the thrust of the initiative is on spotting and nurturing talent in rural parts of the country. Currently, SEPT has soccer nurseries in 51 centres . These include rural region, urban region, a tribal region and coastal region.</p>

			<h3>Bharatheeya Vichara Kendram Research Centre</h3>
			<h4>ABOUT</h4>
			<p>We are living in a fast-changing world. The tide of globalisation is sweeping across the continents, upsetting and uprooting longstanding cultures and traditions, values and attitudes and forcing radical changes whose consequences are unpredictable. Countries like India whose cultural vitality has withstood the shocks of untold foreign invasions and alien cultural onslaughts are now facing serious problems of survival. Cultural diversity, varied lifestyles, Bio-diversity and dignity of individuals and groups are under threat by the onrush of a consumeristic and materialistic civilization,which has no foundation of a wholesome philosophy,or integral vision of life. For the sake of humanity’s futre well being, this threat has to be squarely faced at all levels. Bharatheeya Vichara Kendram has been visualized as an intellectual forum which can take up such challenges effectively, through in-depth studies, research and propagation of ideas among the elite and the common masses. It was founded in the year 1982 and has at present, thirty functioning units in academically important centers of Kerela.</p>
