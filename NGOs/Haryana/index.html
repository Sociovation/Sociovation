			<p>The Wildlife Protection Society Of India (WPSI) was founded in 1994 by Belinda Wright, its Executive Director, who was an award-winning wildlife photographer and filmmaker till she took up the cause of conservation. From its inception, WPSI's main aim has been to bring a new focus to the daunting task of tackling India's growing wildlife crisis.

			<h3>Literacy India</h3>
			<p>Literacy India can rightly be synonymized with three very powerful words: Education, Empowerment and Employment. The very essence of Literacy India are these three E’s which are both powerful and paramount in transforming lives!</p>
			<p>The name Literacy India is a misnomer because, although literacy is the predominant initiative of the organization, this initiative is reinforced with a variety of vocational skills and alternative models of education that are relevant, holistic and enriching. Capt. Indrani Singh, who conceptualized Literacy India says,” the idea is to equip underprivileged children and women with basic education and also identify, nurture and develop their latent talent and skills wherein empowering them and increasing their employability quotient”.</p>
			<h4>VISION</h4>
			<p>It is Literacy India’s motto to impart basic education to women and children. The emphasis is on providing education not in a typical classroom manner, but to give a child a wider canvas of exposure in a socio-cultural environment. Literacy India envisions to keep its student’s at par with the fast evolving world around them. In line with this thought, Literacy India is looking at transforming the education landscape through exposing the student to a more innovative and non-traditional method of learning. This includes fun activities and workshops on group learning, drama, dance, role plays etc.</p>

But in some cases after few months of the birth, the family discovers that the child is not able to hold objects, crawl or walk. A spine chilling news is broken to the parents that the child has an incurable and irreversible condition called ‘Cerebral Palsy’ and may never be able to hold neck, walk or talk like a normal child next door. A sense of gloom dawns for a few days, at times, it lingers on for many years before the parents get adjusted to the thought of being mother and father of a spastic child. But, then, life is as such. One is to outgrow this sense of gloom.</p>
			<p>On the positive side, in the journey of life, parents are blessed with a new companion who is to be taken care of. In case of cerebral palsy the period of care is prolonged and provides more psychological fulfillment to parents whereas bestowing of filial love on children is concerned. But, one feeling which one is unable to overcome as a parent to a spastic child is that what will happen to the child after death of the mother, the father or the caregiver, towards whom the child was always anxiously looking for all his daily care and emotional needs. This thought prompted us to take certain initiatives for short term and long term care of these children.</p>

			<h3>Hema Foundation</h3>
			<p>Hema Foundation is a philanthropic arm of the Ram Ratna Group, working towards imparting CULTURAL & MORAL EDUCATION to children at a very impressionable young age. The foundation looks to enlighten children about the key roles played by parents and society in shaping them into fine individuals. It aims to cultivate better and compassionate understanding of their responsibilities towards Self, Family, Society, the Nation at large, and help them become better human beings.</p>
			<p>The importance of Value Education has been long recognized but the methods to impart have not been definitive. Seeing is Believing. There is no impact quite like a visual impact. With this understanding, the foundation has produced few short films on Human Values with strong meaningful messages. An interactive session between the teacher and the children on the relevant subject, followed by playing of the documentaries and ending with resolutions, would be an high impact method to drive the point across into the hearts and minds of children.</p>
