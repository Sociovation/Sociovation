			<h2>NASA LAUNCHES WORLD'S LIGHTEST SATELLITE DESIGNED BY 18-YEAR-OLD TAMIL NADU STUDENT</h2>
			<h5>Innovation, Dec 7, 2017</h5>
			<img src="../src/img/innovations/SmallestSattelite.jpg" id="smal" style="float:right;">
			<h2>Smallest 3D-printed satellite</h2>
			<p>On Thursday, India once again broke a global space record by launching the world's lightest satellite weighing a mere 64 grams, called Kalamsat, designed and developed not by professional space scientists and engineers, but by 18-year-old Tamil Nadu student Rifath Sharook and his team.</p>
			<h4>Named after Abdul Kalam</h4>
			<p>The tiny satellite, named after Abdul Kalam, was flown by a Nasa sounding rocket and the lift-off was from the space agency's Wallop Island facility around 3pm (IST). Kalamsat was the only Indian payload in the mission.</p>
			<h4>A satellite made at home</h4>
			<p>Mission director Srimathy Kesan told Times of India that the total flight time of the rocket was 240 minutes. The satellite, assembled at her T.Nagar residence in Chennai, separated from the rocket after spending 125 minutes in the space's micro-gravity environment.</p>
			<h4>"Kalamsat fell into the sea. It will be recovered and Nasa will be sending it back to us for decoding the data," she said.</h4>
			<h4>Specs of the smallest satellite</h4>
			<p>The satellite, weighing a mere 64 grams, can be held in one's palm is a 3.8cm cube and its structure is fully 3D-printed with reinforced carbon fiber polymer. It is equipped with a nano Geiger Muller counter which will measure radiation in space.</p>

			<h2>ENVIGREEN EDIBLE BAGS</h2>
			<h5>Environment, Sep 2, 2017</h5>
			<img src="../src/img/innovations/EnviGreen.png" style="width:100%">
			<p>The partial or total ban on plastic bags in several Indian cities is often lauded as a welcome move by most people. As it should be! But if you ask those who cannot afford alternatives like cloth bags (or forget to bring them to the market) – using just hands to carry eggs and vegetables home can be a juggling act. It was this problem faced by ordinary citizens that disturbed Ashwath Hegde, a Mangalore-born but now Qatar-based NRI entrepreneur.</p>
			<h4>“The Mangalore City Corporation implemented a ban on the manufacture, sale, and distribution of plastic bags in the year 2012. But the decision was taken without preparations for alternatives. People were concerned about how they would carry products from the market now. Everyone cannot afford a bag worth Rs. 5 or Rs. 15 to carry a kilogram of sugar. I decided to come up with alternatives after hearing about these problems in my hometown,” says the 25-year-old.</h4>
			<p>After researching the problem for about four years, Ashwath founded EnviGreen – a company that produces 100% organic, biodegradable, and eco-friendly bags.
			<br>
			They look like plastic bags but are made of materials like natural starch and vegetable oil derivatives. If placed in a glass of water at normal temperature, an EnviGreen bag dissolves in a day. And when placed in a glass of boiling water, it dissolved in just 15 seconds! These bags take less than 180 days to biodegrade naturally once discarded. So users can throw them away without worrying about harming the environment. The bags are even edible and will cause no harm to animals if ingested.
			<br>
			Ashwath, who has patented EnviGreen, claims the manufacturing process for these bags is entirely different from that of plastic, cloth, or paper bags. The company uses 12 ingredients, including potato, tapioca, corn, natural starch, vegetable oil, banana, and flower oil.
			All raw materials are first converted into liquid form and then taken through a six-step procedure before the end product is ready.</p>
			<h4>“We don’t use any chemicals at all. Even the paint used for printing on the bags is natural and organic,” says Ashwath. He adds that the cost of one EnviGreen bag is about 35% more than that of a plastic bag, but 500% less than that of a cloth bag. “To give you a rough idea, an EnviGreen bag measuring 13 inches by 16 inches costs Rs. 3, while a plastic bag with the same dimensions will cost Rs. 2”.</h4>
			<p>The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB), which has approved the use of these bags, conducted several tests to ensure there were no plastic elements in them. The tests included placing a hot iron on a small piece of EnviGreen sheet. The sheet neither melts nor sticks to the hot iron surface. The bags also don’t melt, drip, or release any toxic fumes when burnt, unlike conventional plastic bags. They have been tested by the Central Institute of Plastic Engineering and Sriram Institute for Industrial Research as well.To prove his point, Ashwath has even consumed a bag after boiling it in water to show that it is edible.
			<br>
			With his team of 60 people, Ashwath has now set up a factory in Bangalore that produces 1,000 metric tonnes of bags every month. “We had this unique idea of empowering farmers in rural Karnataka by sourcing all our raw materials from them. We are also planning to distribute seeds to help them produce the amount of materials required to make the bags,” he says.
			<br>
			Currently, the company has not started sales in India, but the bags are already available in Qatar and Abu Dhabi.</p>
			<h4>“Just the city of Bangalore consumes over 30,000 metric tonnes of plastic bags every month. So we want to set up enough manufacturing facilities before we start distributing to individual customers and local kirana shop owners. We have started supplying to corporate retail chains like Metro and Reliance, which will start using the bags from December this year,” says Ashwath.
			According to the Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, 15,000 tonnes of plastic waste is generated in India every day, out of which 9,000 tonnes is collected and processed, while 6,000 tonnes is not collected.</h4>
			<p>Once available for use, EnviGreen bags will not just help ease this problem but also help many consumers struggling to find a balance between their concern for the environment and ways of making things more comfortable in their daily lives.</p>

			<h2>DESKIT</h2>
			<h5>Innovation, Jan 27, 2018</h5>
			<img src="../src/img/innovations/DESKIT.png" id="smal" style="float:right">
			<p>Scores of children pan-India might benefit from DESKIT, an initiative by an IIT-Kanpur graduate named Eshan Sadasivan. Weighing just 1 kilo, the bag will help school students write without pain, allowing them to maintain proper body posture.</p>
			<h4>The bag has a detachable plywood study table with foldable legs made of Mild Steel tubes, weighing only 680 grams. The table is attached to the bag’s front flap, to avoid contact with the student’s back.</h4>
			<p>Eshan was inspired to make this contraption, when, during his IIT-Kanpur tenure, he saw students of government schools in nearby areas working sans infrastructure, both at school and at home. That is what motivated the 27-year old to start DESKIT. He recalls how happy the kids were when they were presented with the bag. Elaborating on their health concerns, he speaks of their back pain issues at a tender age, which was affecting their interest in academics, amongst other things.</p>
			<p>Eshan obviously has done something right–around 17,000 students are using the bag, in more than ten states, he says. He speaks of a newer version with an LED lamp for facilitating night-studies. Eshan runs PROSOC, which is the abbreviated form of Products for Society while pursuing his PhD on social entrepreneurship from IIT Kanpurties.</p>
			<p>PROSOC got a grant of Rs 20-lakh from the Central Government under the PRISM (Promoting Innovations in Individuals, Startups and MSMEs) and NIDHI (National Initiative for Developing and Harnessing Innovations) Prayas schemes. The company has also received international assistance from the Government of Scotland for its innovation.</p>
			<p>Eshan wants to come up with more innovative products in various domains, to help and empower people at the bottom of the pyramid, across sectors. Speaking of the little breakthrough in hardware product innovation in the education sector, he says that innovation in this space will motivate kids to attend school. Which is why, besides education, the company is also working in the agricultural and livelihood sectors.</p>
