			The name of our organization – Aavishkaar -means ‘invention’ in Hindi. Founded in 2001, with a vision to catalyse development in India’s underserved regions, it identifies capable entrepreneurs, provides them with capital, supplements it with a nurturing environment and helps build sustainable enterprises.
			Aavishkaar’s big innovation is the adoption of venture capital methodology to serve the low_income market segment by creating scalable enterprises. Aavishkaar’s founding team faced the challenge of modifying the investing methodology followed in the Silicon Valley. Funding in the Valley typically focused on new technologies and breakthroughs in intellectual property. Back home, Aavishkaar had to adapt it to brick and mortar, investing in hinterland and rural geographies with a target clientele that had a tiny wallet. At the same time, reasonable returns had to be delivered to investors. This meant that Aavishkaar with its limited capital and resources had to find a large number of start_up companies scattered across underdeveloped regions and then invest small amounts of capital in them.</p>
			<h4>Vision</h4>
			<p>Aavishkaar's vision is to catalyze equitable development globally by supporting entrepreneurial intervention through provision of risk capital.</p>
			<h4>Mission</h4>
			<p>Aavishkaar's mission is to evolve an approach to investing that nurture entrepreneurs in building enterprises that can generate commercial returns while serving humanity sustainably.</p>

			<H3>ABILITY ON WHEELS </H3>
			<p>Ability on Wheels is an effort to encourage the differently- abled to take a big leap towards leading a normal life by increasing mobility and accessibility services and solutions. As a first step in this direction, it has launched a first- of- its- kind driving school in India, exclusively for the differently- abled using customized cars in Ahmedabad.
			Today, the physically challenged have to first buy a car, get it modified and only then are they provided a learner’s license. This deprives them of the right to first learn and then buy a car. Also, since there is no such driving school they have to learn on their own. Due to this big stumbling block, many physically challenged individuals hesitate to buy a car and hence are deprived of their freedom and independence.
			The biggest benefit of this driving school is that now people can get a learner’s license based on the customized vehicles of the driving school so that they can first learn driving and then go in to buy a car. Today Ability on Wheels runs the only driving school across entire country exclusively for people with disabilities.</p>
			<h4>Vision</h4>
			<p>Inclusion of ‘specially abled’ in the community stream by empowering, facilitating and training them to drive vehicles.</p>
			<h4>Mission</h4>
			<p>To connect people with disabilities, educate and create opportunities for them to make the most of their abilities, while advocating social change by enhancing the quality of life with developmental or physical abilities through an array of services.</p>

			<h3>SEWA RURAL</h3>
			<p>
			SEWA Rural, a voluntary, development-oriented institution has been working incessantly for the past 37 years for the improvement of people in their health and other fields in the rural and tribal areas of Jhagadia in South Gujarat. Inspired by the ideals of Swami Vivekananda and Gandhiji, the activities were started by a group of educated young professionals having work experience in India and abroad. Over the years many like-minded individuals joined hands with them in the development of the organization and made it what it is today.
			It has been the endeavour of SEWA Rural to reach out to improve the lives of the very poor and underprivileged through a variety of health, education and economic development programmes based on the needs of the community in these aspects. Preservation of the intrinsic value systems and broad based development of all those involved including the beneficiaries are kept in mind while carrying out these activities. The focus of all programmes has been the vulnerable members of the family, viz. the women, children and elderly of the poor sections of the society.	
			In all the activities, an attempt is made to incorporate as well as balance the three basic principles: Social Service, Scientific Approach and Spiritual Outlook.</p>
