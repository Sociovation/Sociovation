			<h3>ADITYA MEHTA FOUNDATION(AMF)</h3>
			<p>Aditya Mehta Foundation (AMF) helps people with significant disabilities to pursue their sport of choice and lead a self-sustaining life.</p>
			<p>Our vision is to see a bright sporting career for people with disabilities.</p>
			<p>Aditya Mehta Foundation (AMF) is a non-profit organisation which aids people with disabilities to pursue sports while providing self-sustenance. India has almost 22.4% of people who are disabled in different forms including blindness, speech, hearing, movement and mental. AMF aims to help them reach their potential in their chosen field of sports and help them have a self-sustaining life.</p>
			<p>In India 85% of young adults with profound disabilities in India experience life-long unemployment and have just one-tenth the opportunity for social participation outside the home compared with the “average” Indian. Apart from this, many disabled people who would otherwise have been great sports persons cannot pursue their choice of sport due to disabilities. AMF provides all support including equipment, coaching, counseling etc. to help them to pursue sports to instill independence, rehabilitate them and reinstall them into society.</p>

			<p>Bal Mahila Kalyan (BMK) founded in 1990, a non-governmental Organization, was registered under the Societies Act 1860 vide number 293dt 8-8-1991, FCRA act 1976 no 03130001 dated 17-12-1993 and also under the Income Tax Act under Section 12A and 80G. No CIT/BGP/Tech/1222-25 & 1226-31 has its office at Vikash Ashram, Officers Colony, Mirchaibari, Katihar, Bihar, India. BMK also owns about 3 acres of land at Dandkhora Block in Katihar District. More than a dozen full-time and more than three dozen part-time staff under the direct guidance of Smt. Anila Kumari, Secretary BMK, carry out its activitie.</p>
			<p>The organization has acted as a catalyst to improve the socio-economic status of women in villages. It started off with forming “Self Help Groups” (SHG) to empower women economically. It was not an easy path. Initially when the women were asked to save money together as a group they were scared that all their money would be lost. The banks refused to open accounts for them. But middle aged women like Smt. Soghra Khatoon, Smt. Farida Khatoon, and Smt. Raqibun etc were enthused and finally they could open an account at the Kosi Kshetriya Gramin Bank. Various enterprises were taken up – manufacturing of jute handicrafts, for which training was imparted by us in our headquarters, manufacture of plastic toys, poultry farming etc. Ready buyers were found in the local markets. Bank loans were repaid in time; the bank had found a new segment of honest customers. Soon other banks followed e. g. State Bank of India, Central Bank of India etc. Some of these groups were designated as ideal e.g. Mahila Sakti Abhilasa, Nari Pragati, Anmol Mahila Jagran etc. They influenced other women in nearby villages to form new SHG’s. This new found economic freedom enhanced the status of these women in the eyes of the men in their families and mohalla and they became self confident. Women are now respected by men and their voice counts while making a decision which was not the case earlier. BMK has till now been able to initiate the formation of more than five hundred SHG’s.</p>

			<h3>GREEN FOUNDATION</h3>
			<p>Our work to empower the small scale and marginal farmers of India first began in 1994 with a simple effort to distribute indigenous seed varieties in and around the village of Thalli, Tamil Nadu. This soon turned into a growing biodiversity conservation programme that has been central to our work ever since.</p>
			<p><b>MISSION :</b>
				<br>
			<p>Conserve local seed diversity, promote an increased reliance on biodiversity-based ecological agriculture, and use these as foundations for endogenous growth and development of rural communities.</p>
			<p>Create a gender-sensitive environment that enhances women’s leadership skills.</p>
			<p>Contribute to livelihoods by creatively marketing “value-added” cultivated and wild agricultural biodiversity.</p>
			<p>Connect the natural elements—soil, water, air, sunlight, and seed—to ensure an abundance of nutritious food and other basic community needs.</p>
			<p>Continue to nurture community participation and assist in building robust community institutions.</p>

			<h3>PEOPLE FIRST EDUCATIONAL CHARITABLE TRUST</h3>
			<p>People First  based in Bodhgaya started its work in 1992 in the village of Piani, in Jharkhand India.  Visiting the desperately poor village our founding members, Deepak Kumar and Nick Hansen were moved by the sight of a small child sitting on old sacking with a few school books  outside the government village school waiting for a teacher who never came.  A simple school was started and from that simple beginning People First was born. Now employing over 100 people (nearly all service providers) the Trust now works in Health Education, child protection and welfare, women's rights and poverty alleviation  and education</p>

			<h3>NAV JAGRITI</h3>
			<p>Founded in 1993, Nav Jagriti is recognized as a pioneer grassroots organization in Bihar. It was founded as a society by the group of likeminded and concerned youth of Parsa block of Saran district with an objective to mitigate the flood hazards and to provide a pro active citizen centric public services in the flood prone area of North Bihar. The main motivation of its genesis was heading a great struggle by the youth of Parsa block who were empathised seeing the victims of the fatal flood and continuous water logging since decades in his area. Finally in 1991 these youth had started an informal organization “Jal Jamao Virodhee Sangharsh committee”. Initially the committee was dedicatedly highlighting and raising the issues related to flood and its disaster on different platforms but it was limited to Saran only. These youth had wings of fire thus they were unstoppable. They wanted to bring a larger social change in the lives of people who were affected by the flood, thus that informal committee turns into a structured organization called Nav Jagriti (NJ) and since its inception it has been working day in day out.</p>
			<p><b>Vision : </b>Nav Jagriti aspires to ensure dignified life and better living conditions for the poor, disadvantaged and vulnerable sections of the society.</p>

			<h3>GRAM VIKAS PARISHAD</h3>
			<p>Gram Vikas Parishad (GVP), within 25 years of its inception in 1987, has become a synonymous with women’s empowerment, child labour rehabilitation etc. Working in some of the poorest districts of India, Madhubani, Darbhanga, Samastipur, Madhepura, Saharsa, Araria, Supaul, Sheohar and Sitamarhi (Bihar), GVP had to face blockades at every step. The geographical terrain compounded by political apathy has led to many miseries in the region.</p>
			<p>Due to the number of rivers, the region is flood prone, economically impoverished due to lack of industrial infrastructure, and finally lack of development due to political apathy. GVP answered the need of the region for a strong willed organization to lift the morale of the people in general, empower the women subjected to suppression for centuries, child labour working in the local brick kilns and child labor, safe migration ,Income genaration, Community Empowerment, climate change, rampant human trafficking from Nepal and Bangladesh due to the proximity of the borders. GVP has emerged as the only Resource Centre in this region on the social issues, it not only provides training to the partner NGOs and but also provides data to the funding organizations on the various issues of concern to them.</p>
			<p>The respect for the organization can be seen in the eyes of the millions of poor people living in the area WE MADE A DIFFERENCE…</p>

			<h3>SAMAJIK SHAIKSHANIK VIKAS KENDRA</h3>
			<p>Locating the developmental anomaly in structural causes such as control/ownership of and access to resources; economic, political and social structures; ideological factors (habits, beliefs, cultural preferences); and insufficient awareness and knowledge; SSVK stands committed to the effective empowerment of the marginalised people. It lays a strategic focus on the element of local action, treating it as an essential part of the development process involving changes, most important of which is, in the attitude and action of the marginalised who become participants in the process itself. Rural development is viewed as a complex process involving continuous reorientation and adaptation of traditional values , practices and institutions in order to facilitate appropriate interventions/technologies to enhance quality of life and welfare, and the consequent bargaining /negotiating powers, of the disenfranchised and the disempowered.</p>
