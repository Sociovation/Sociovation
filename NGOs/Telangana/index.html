			<h3>Adarana- Home for underprivileged and needy children</h3>
			<p>Today millions of children are deprived of their childhood rights- right to live, right to education. Their childhood dreams are shattered because of their poverty.</p>
			<p>These hapless children are forced to child labour. The environment in which they work prompts them to nurse a grudge against the cruelty of their masters and the unkind society at large. Slowly they take to vices and finally are driven to the world of crime. This is the unfortunate scourge of our society.</p>
			<p>These children of circumstances should be lifted from the gutters and hugged with much love and care. Thus AADARANA founded by Sri.Jadi Madhava Rao who had been nursing a sincere desire to help these poor souls to become respectable citizens in future.</h4>
			<p>AADARANA picks these unlucky kids up, free them from child labor, and also the children rotting in gutters and undesirable environments. They are given love and protection, food and shelter, education and careers and ushered into respectable lives.</p>

			<p>The first step in our 17 years of journey was supporting women SHG movement in the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh in 2001 and across several states in the country. The credibility gained in terms of building social capital through strengthening of rural and urban SHGs provided an impetus to empower the poor and marginalized communities through promotion of livelihoods, natural resources management, integrated farming systems, farmer producer organizations, and model villages besides reaching out to a few developing countries (Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Thailand, Myanmar and Vietnam).</p>
			<p>Currently we have direct field presence in the states of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Bihar and through SHPIs (self-help promoting institutions) in Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra. Whereas, the focus of our capacity building initiatives and Research & Advocacy is in several states across and outside the country. The programmes that are currently being implemented could be categorized into three major streams</p>

			<h3>Anuraag Human Services</h3>
			<p>In The History of social service activities saw the beginning of a small effort by a group of professionals who together floated an organization to serve needy Destitute Disabled, Women, Children and Aged persons. This small effort which began with rehabilitation service for 3 Disabled persons in small shed has grown in leaps and bound, with a great deal of support from many well-wishers to the present status. The unending guidance and support of all the welfare oriented persons who are associated with us, has been the back bone which neither bent nor broke, over these years of hurdles and pit falls faced by the management and executed team. We are extremely thankful to God and the dedicated persons associated in helping the organization grow and shine in all its radiant colours as a well-established non-profit service organization. The ensuing paragraphs give a gist of all service programs of the organization.

			<h3>Anveshi Research Centre for Women’s Studies</h3>
			<p>Anveshi was set up in 1985 in Hyderabad by a small group of activist-scholars to provide resources to research and develop a feminist theory relevant to women’s lives in contemporary India. Today we are one of the foremost non-university research centers in India. Our work focuses on six research initiatives: education; health and health care systems; law and critical legal theory; dalits and minorities; development; and public domain. Projects in these initiatives examine the shifts in development theory; the crisis of medicine in the Indian context; hegemonic perspectives in school textbooks; the question of secularism and minority in Indian politics; the problematic nature of law and rights in domestic violence; and thinking about what it entails to be a ‘Dalit woman’ in modern India.

			<h3>Centre for development and research</h3>
			<p>Centre for Development and Research (CDR) is a registered, not for profit organisation working for the development of tribal communities in the State of Andhra Pradesh, since 1983.</p>
			<p>CDR started its work in 1983 by assisting the tribal communities in 41 villages of Jainoor and Sirpur (U) mandals in Adilabad District in identifying and executing drought relief works. CDR also was instrumental in preparation of people centered village development documents that were presented to the government. The government, perhaps for the first time, had the opportunity to participate in a programme designed and implemented by the people. The programme was drawn up in all the 41 villages as per the priorities decided by the community. This decentralized people owned village development experience was influential later in formulation of the community centered Janma Bhoomi programme implemented by the then Government of Andhra Pradesh, during the years 1994 - 2003.
