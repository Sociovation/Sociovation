			<h3>Abilashrayam</h3>
			<h4>AbOUT</h4>
			<p>Abilashrayam (Desire to care), ngo in Bangalore was founded and established in the year 2009 by Mr. Kalyan Krishna. We started our first project as "Little Pencils" orphanage in Bangalore by taking care of five children. We slowly expanded our support to close to twenty children. Thus it all began by taking care of five children. 
			In the due course of time, a legion of likeminded individuals joined the cause and motivated Mr. Kalyan Krishna to undertake many more such initiatives. During this period, the organization started providing educational support to the underprivileged children belonging to the rural areas. Thus i-educate project was launched and supported Two Hundred and Fifty children in its inaugural launch itself. In the following year we supported more than 1500 children under i-educate project. 
			Today, we can proudly say we are supporting thousands of children across the country through our various programs and initiatives. The organization is also supporting senior citizens (through senior citizen home & other ways), women and youth in rural areas of India.
			</p>
			<h4>Vision</h4>
			<p>To promote ability among all the orphaned/abandoned/underprivileged children, senior citizens within and outside the support system, by educating, guiding and giving them the love and care which they deserve. We act as a transition for these children to lead a life with complete social dignity and also make them able, to help the society in return.</p>
			<h4>Mission</h4>
			<p> To continue doing our work with social responsibility, so that we can restore the bright future of these innocent lives. </p>

			<h3>ASHA Foundation</h3>
			<h4>ABOUT</h4>
			<p>Decades ago, an American who had come to India fell ill and was admitted to a hospital in Bangalore. Within 48 hours, his condition deteriorated.

That encounter was the catalyst for the birth of ASHA Foundation, Bangalore – a vision and a dream that soon became a reality.

			<h3>Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE)</h3>
			<h4>ABOUT</h4>
			<p>Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE) is a global non-profit organisation which generates interdisciplinary knowledge to inform policy and practice towards conservation and sustainability.
			For over two decades, ATREE has worked on social-environmental issues from local to global policy levels. ATREE envisions a society committed to environmental conservation and sustainable and socially just development.
			Our mission is to generate rigorous interdisciplinary knowledge for achieving environmental conservation and sustainable development, to enable the use of this knowledge by policy makers and society, and to train the next generation of environmental leaders.
			To deliver on our mission, we work across issues like biodiversity and conservation, climate change mitigation and development, land and water resources, forests and governance and ecosystem services and human well-being.
			Structure
			ATREE's organisational structure is designed to promote creative interdisciplinary approaches that integrate research with policy and action in addressing critical environmental problems. Two research
			centres, the Centre for Biodiversity and Conservation and the Centre for Environment and Development, together with the Academy of Conservation Science and Sustainability Studies, provide the structure to conduct insightful research that fuels our thought leadership on policy issues and drives our capacity building activities.

			<h3>Baale Mane </h3>
			<h4>Vision</h4>
			<p>The Baale Mane (‘Girl’s Home’ in Kannada, the local language in Bangalore) is a home situated on the outskirts of the city of Bangalore, India, for up to 50 girls between the ages of 7 and 18. We welcome and support girls of all faiths and we do not discriminate on the grounds of caste or creed.
			Where possible, the aim of our home is to reunite the girls with their family but where this is neither possible nor desirable, the girls are given long term care and protection at the Baale. Our ambition is to nurture and resource the girls for an independent and self-sustaining adult life.
			Baale Mane focusses on teaching their girls how to productively challenge the rigid norms dictating gender structures, power inequities and oppressive socially accepted roles and expectations of women in their communities. Baale Mane helps the girls make educated, informed choices surrounding their careers, sexuality and well-being, aiming is to equip each girl with the necessary skills to lead an independent life. 
			-Kim Burnett, President and CEO, Shadhika Foundation
			Education is at the heart of our approach. All of our girls attend local government or state aided schools as well as receiving extra tuition at the Baale. Girls in 7th standard and above attend English medium school if they come to the Baale early enough and are judged to have the ability to thrive in this environment.
			We place great emphasis on the all-round development of our girls and have a strong focus on the arts as a means of self-expression. Dance, drama and other forms of creative expression are also an important part of life at Baale.

			<h3>Karunashraya</h3>
			<h4>ABOUT</h4>
			<p>Karunashraya, meaning ‘an abode of compassion’ is a five-acre haven of lush greenery, bird  song and peace, in the midst of the hustle and bustle of a densely populated, prime location on Old Airport – Varthur Main Road, just prior to the Kundalahalli Junction. The building that houses the hospice with its stone exterior is impressive and has won acclaim as one of the most well-designed hospice buildings in “20th Century World Architecture – The Phaidon Atlas Buildings Completed between 1900 and 1999”.

			PALLIATIVE CARE & KARUNASHRAYA: Cancer is a leading cause of death in India with nearly 3 million suffering from it. WHO predicts that 700,000 people will succumb to the disease on an annual basis by 2015. Nearly 80% of cancer patients in India access medical help when there is no hope for cure! The need for palliative care has never been more critical, especially in Bangalore – the ‘Cancer Capital of India’.
			The building architected by M/s Chandavarkar & Thacker is a green marvel. Both the architectural team and the Karunashraya team were ahead of their times in thinking green.
