			<h4>ABOUT</h4>
			<p>Lokshakti Samajsevi Sanstha is implementing the “Achieving Total Sanitation in Rajnandgaon by strentheining PRIs and building accountability of Service Providers” Program because we observed from our past experience that the PRI is the first legal responsible unit for implementing the WASH program at the village level. The main role of the service providers is to support the people in making this program a success. But, both PRI and service providers aren’t much aware about the WASH program and due to the lack of their interest also in the WASH program, demand wasn’t generating from the community which wasn’t building the pressure on the government for the timely releasing of budget on WASH related programs, the wash program wasn’t progressing in the Rajnandgaon district. Hence, the organisation (LSS) planned to create campaign in the Rajnandgaon district which would strengthen the PRIs, build the accountability of the service providers and creating awareness among the communities for their rights so that the program may progress speedily and the WASH program reach the deprived people. We shared this plan with the Water Aid, they understood our plan and agreed to support us in achieving our planned strategies.</p>
			<h4>Vission</h4>
			<p>LSS vision is creation of exploitation free society with equal rights for human being where every person has an opportunity to live with self-respect.</p>
			<h4>Mission</h4>
			<p>The mission of LSS is to bring about awareness among poor women and men so that larger organization is built up for getting their rights and for achieving their own comprehensive development</p>

			<h3>RAMAKRISHNA MISSION ASHRAMA</h3>
			<h4>ABOUT</h4>
			<p>Started in 1985, the Ramakrishna Mission Ashrama, Narainpur, along with its 6 Service Centers inside Abujhmarh jungle villages of Chhattisgarh State, has been serving the tribal brothers and sisters of the area who had been the mute victims of several centuries of oppression and utter neglect.

			Aujhmarh has a tribal population of about 34,000 inhabiting some 233 far-flung villages over a sprawling area of 4000 sq.km. It is described as a "tangled knot of hills" having an inaccessible terrain that remains absolutely cut off from the rest of the civilized world for about 6 months a year even to this day.
			Narainpur is the gateway to Abujhmarh Hills in Chhattisgarh. A 'marh' (Highlands) which is 'abujh' (unknown) is Abujhmarh. True to its name, it still continues to be rather unknown and unsurveyed area. Surrounded on all sides by a chain of hills and dense forests, this vast tract of land stretching into some 4,000 Sq. Km. is home to perhaps the most primitive tribes still surviving, and is sparsely populated. The 'hill Marias' - the Marias living in the hills - happen to be the most predominant inhabitants of this vast area, backward and disadvantaged in may ways. The 'hill Marias' live in an inaccessible geographical terrain that remains cut-off from the rest of the world during the rainy season. Because of their extreme geographical isolation for long, the Hill Marias have very primitive economy, their mainstay being the slash- and-burn cultivation practiced on the steep hill slopes. They also collect forest produce like Chironji, Tamarind, Resin, Cocoons, Sinhadi leafs, Mahua, Salseeds, Tendu Patta, Lac etc.
