			<h3>Tarun Bharat Sangh</h3>
			<p>Established in Jaipur in 1975, Tarun Bharat Sangh was initiated by a group of professors & students of University of Rajasthan. But the real journey of TBS started on 2nd October 1985, when a battery of four youths charged to transfer it from urban to rural India. They started with a mission to move the people out of their feeling of helplessness in the face of the ravages of nature and an indifferent administration. Four youths including Rajendra Singh (present chairman) inspired by Gandhian model of rural-development went to live in a village of Alwar district of Rajasthan for rural uplift. They started a school for children but soon got very depressed seeing no response from villagers.</p>
			<h4>Our mission</h4>
			<p>Tarun Bharat Sangh seeks to bring dignity and prosperity to the life of a destitute section of the nation through sustainable development measures. TBS aims for the holistic development of men, women, and children, regardless of economic situation, caste or religion. TBS promotes the community-driven-decentralized-management of the natural resources.</p>

VAAGDHARA draws its name from its area of working i.e. Vaagad-the tribal area of Rajasthan adjoining Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh on banks of river and Dhara-stream of development. The core value of the organization is swaraj ‘self-reliance’ which is drawn from Gandhian philosophy, but at the same time, it believes in the use of latest technology for the development of tribal and poor.</p>
			<p>During last decade and half, VAAGDHARA has impacted about 25000 tribal and poorest of poor families to bring change in quality of their life. It has implemented a number of interventions with support of government, national and international organizations like UNDP, UNICEF, WFP, Welthungerhilfe, NABARD, IGSSS, Save the Children, Plan India and so on. The main driver of the organizational philosophy is the ‘context and issues that tribal and poor face’ in southern Rajasthan. It has been adequately flexible in its approach and depending on the need of the situation, VAAGDHARA has played key role as activist to advocate for child rights, as facilitator in collaboration with mainstream (government) for betterment of school education and has also implemented natural resource management programs like Sustainable Integrated Farming. It has learned from its experiences and used the learning in designing new and improved interventions.</p>

			<h3>Gramin Vikas Evam Paryavaran Sanstha</h3>
			<p>In response to the grim situation of natural resources and human development in the rural areas of district Dausa, some young volunteers’ along with Mr. Harishankar Sharma initiated developmental activities in one village. Initially the activities that the group had undertaken were related to welfare of the persons living at margins particularly the ST and SC population, which contributes a substantial part in the area’s population. Gradually, the group expanded the scope of its activities in the areas of women development, education, social advocacy and natural resources management under the aegis of the newly formed society named Gramin Vikas evem Paryavaran Sanstha – GVePS.</p>
			<p>Over the years different donors including both the domestic and the international have shown keen interest in organization’s endeavors and supported the organization in multiple ways. The team has got sufficient capacity building inputs from various sources. GVePS has got a small team of committed grassroots workers along with a cadre of volunteers. GVePS as an organization strongly believes in the peoples power and democratic processes.</p>
