			<p>We run waste collections in Dehradun, Dharamsala and Corbett and work in accordance with the Municipal Solid Waste Rules 2000. Ensuring waste is segregated at source is essential if we are to maximise on recycling. We have different bags for recyclable and non recyclable waste and request that food waste is kept separate. We separate the recyclables into different categories so it can be sold to the kabaddiwala and only send non recyclable waste to the trenching grounds. Food and garden waste is composted and turned into fertiliser.</p>

A society like this may be far away but with every campaign, every class and every meeting, we take one step closer to our goal. It will take decades to reach the society we wish to create however, we hope to push society there quicker. Nothing will change without education and education takes time.</p>

This progress, however, is not enough and we won't stop until women have their voices and are completely equal to men. We won't stop until everyone has the opportunity to have their voice heard and has the ability to fulfill their goals.</p>

			<h3>SAMVEDANA</h3>
			<p>Founded in 2003, Samvedana is a non-profit organization registered under Bombay Public Trust Act, 1950. We work for the integrated development of slums with a focus on education, nutrition and skill development of socially and economically deprived children, youth and women. Our main projects are in more than 50 slum communities in the western periphery of the city and 4 villages in the district of Ahmedabad.</p>
			<p>Apart from education initiatives, we have also been working for the malnourished children as a partner with the government’s ICDS project. Under this initiative, Samvedana monitors and adds value to 76 aanganwadis. Through our 4 different projects focusing on education, nutrition and skill development today we have touched lives of over 1 lac 25 thousand beneficiaries which include children, youth and women.</p>
			<p>Driven by sole passion for development of children, we are constantly striving to fulfill our purpose of sensitizing the society and transforming lives. Samvedana has merely been an initiator. It is the relentless support of our team of volunteers, corporates, professionals which has collectively worked towards bringing about the difference.</p>
			<p>Today the world that we live in is highly dynamic, going through radical changes. At Samvedana we are constantly striving to understand the changing needs of our community and adapt to those needs. We strongly believe that by transforming the lives of the underprivileged, our nation will attain holistic development.</p>
