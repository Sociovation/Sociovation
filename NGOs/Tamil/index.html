For his associates, Navajeevan is Thomas. “His love and trust in God keep Navajeevan running. We are all here because of Thomas,” says Rejimon, one of the first to team up with him.
			It is a round-the-clock mission for Thomas and his family is fully behind him in his Endeavour to make the world kinder for them mentally ill. “We are proud of his work. It is God working through him. He would rather we go without food than his children at Navajeevan,”says his wife Laisamma.They have five children: the light of the Thomas household is the youngest, a mentally retarded child, born paralyzed. Thomas believes that God gifted him this child only because he had the trust in him. “I thank God for this child,” he smiles. ((Quoted in The Week dated Apr. 23, 1995).

			<p>Anbalayam, in English, means loving home. Anbalayam, located in the rural town of Sirkali is the home for 55 special-needs children. The home was founded in a rundown rental building by Ms. Meerabai Ekambaram, a local resident with a heart as big as it can be. There are more than 10 million special-needs children in India. Most of the children were abandoned by their parents in public places like bus stands, railroad stations and local markets, with the hope that somehow their children will be taken care of. When Mrs. Meerabai founded Anbalayam in 1998 she had picked the children wandering around in the bus stand at Sirkali. Anbalayam’s children have the typical maladies of special-needs children, mental retardation, cerebral palsy, Downs Syndrome, autism and multiple disabilities. Genetic consanguinity (marrying close relations) is one of the significant causes of offspring that are diagnosed with special-needs. Genetic consanguinity is not un-common, even in highly educated communities in Tamil Nadu.

			<h3>DEPRESSED PEOPLE'S WELFARE ASSOCIATION</h3>
			<h4>ABOUT</h4>
			<p>DPWA owes its origin to the grass root level dedicated social activist and a native Roman Catholic Priest of Trichy District Father S.Dhanapragasam. Having served as a catholic priest for eight years, he resigned his ministry during the process of his treatment to the near fatal injuries he sustained in a road accident on 28th February '85. First as a priest and later as a social worker for all, irrespective of caste/creed, he dedicated himself for the uplift and emancipation of the rural poor. This he had intended to accomplish by liberating these people from their ignorance, unorganized state of affairs, social oppression and from the clutches of poverty.

			All along his dedication, his mind and heart in unison had nurtured a strong concern for the poor children of the area. Their needs and necessities attracted his prime attention. Through trial and error process, he had come to the firm conviction that if his vision to acquire a clear shape, he needed to ORGANISE various activities to benefit the target group in an orderly fashion.

			Born out of this firm conviction was the formation of the Society under the name of DEPRESSED PEOPLE'S WELFARE ASSOCIATION. This non-profit and non-communal rural development society was founded by him in 1985. This society enjoyed the support and the blessings of the local elders of Tiruchirapalli District and was registered under the Society's Act vide No. Sl 29/1985. The administrative office of D.P.W.A. is operating from 25, Annai Nagar, Pitchandarkoil Post, Trichy 621 216, Tamil Nadu. This society is registered under section 10A, 80G of income tax department. This society also has the registration under Foreign Contribution Regulation(FCRA), Home Ministry, Govt. of India under no. 07604099.

The mammoth crowd that followed the adieu procession of the legend Mother Teresa, Dr.G.K.Dhas, a kind hearted social activist took up the challenge of being and working for the poor. From this simple, yet heart breaking incident, brought the determination that, to take the mantle of Mother Teresa, that "Service to Mankind is Service to God". The inspiration which helped to create "Mother Teresa Charitable Trust" is being carried out all these years.

The overwhelming response from the general public is the impetus for the growth of Mother Teresa Charitable Trust. Now Mother Teresa Charitable Trust functions as a social relief NGO striving for the upliftment of poor, sick, downtrodden and the under privileged.

Its sub unit "Mother Teresa Forum" enrolls members and forms committees at national state, district, taluk and village levels. Mother Teresa Charitable Trust serves with the motto of "Service to Humanity". With the partnership of Government & various State governments, as well as the generosity of thousands of our supporters, we have grown from a small endeavor to a mammoth force that stretches across the wide chemesphere . All these years MTCT serve the under privileged and the needy to transform a vision into a reality. Our fight will continue till the last breath of a suffering mass.</p>
